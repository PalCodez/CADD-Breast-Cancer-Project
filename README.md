# Computer Assisted Drug Design (CADD) Project on Breast Cancer :
This project applies computational drug design methods to identify and evaluate therapeutic targets and drug candidates for breast cancer. It includes literature analysis, structural bioinformatics, molecular docking, pathway mapping, and ADME/toxicity profiling using open-source tools and databases.

## Project Objectives
- Select breast cancer due to its global prevalence and data availability.
- Identify and analyze key therapeutic targets using structural bioinformatics.
- Perform molecular docking simulations to evaluate protein-ligand interactions.
- Map biological pathways and networks to understand gene interactions.
- Assess drug-likeness and ADME/Tox properties of candidate compounds.
- Propose a repurposing strategy for existing drugs.

## Methods & Tools Used
### Tools:
- **AutoDock** – Molecular docking
- **PyMOL / Chimera** – Structure visualization
- **KNIME / SwissADME** – ADME and cheminformatics workflows
### Databases:
- **PDB** – Protein structures
- **UniProt** – Protein function and sequences
- **DrugBank, PubChem, ChemBL** – Drug and compound data
- **KEGG (hsa05224)** – Pathway mapping
- **STRING, STITCH, MalaCards** – Interaction networks and disease associations

## Key Highlights
- Docking study: Tamoxifen–ESR1 interaction
- Pathway analysis: BRCA2–RAD51 (KEGG/STRING)
- ADME profiling: Cabazitaxel (LogP, TPSA, MW)
- Repurposing insight: Zoledronic Acid via FDPS inhibition
